# 🤖 DADDY-CLAUDE SYSTEM GUIDE

Welcome to the daddy-claude system! This guide explains everything you need to know about using this powerful development platform.

## 📚 What is Daddy-Claude?

Daddy-claude is a specialized development system that supercharges your coding workflow through:

- **Parallel agent execution** (3-6x faster than sequential work)
- **Specialized language experts** for each programming language
- **Zero-tolerance quality checks** for perfect code
- **Visual progress tracking** with clear status updates

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Create a Project
1. Create a `daddy_project.md` file with your requirements
2. Run `/new-project` to create the task database
3. Run `/start-project` to begin execution

### Step 2: Add Features
When you need new functionality, use `/new-feature [feature name]`
- Example: `/new-feature user authentication`

### Step 3: Validate Everything
Before shipping, run `/check` to validate AND fix everything in your codebase

### Step 4: Ship to Production
When ready, run `/deploy` to ship to production

## 💻 Available Commands

| Command | What It Does | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `/new-project` | Creates task database from spec | Starting new project |
| `/start-project` | Executes tasks in batches | After new-project setup |
| `/new-feature` | Builds complete features | Adding functionality |
| `/check` | Validates AND fixes everything | Want perfect code |
| `/test` | Writes comprehensive tests | Need test coverage |
| `/api` | Builds complete APIs | Creating endpoints |
| `/debug` | Deep troubleshooting | Complex bugs |
| `/refactor` | Improves code quality | Code needs cleanup |
| `/clean` | Removes dead code | Too much unused code |
| `/secure` | Security scanning & fixes | Security concerns |
| `/analyze` | Understands codebase | New to project |
| `/deploy` | Ships to production | Ready to launch |
| `/commit` | Human-style git commits | Save progress |

## ⚡ Why It's Fast

### Parallel Execution
- `/check` runs **6 validation agents simultaneously**
- `/api` builds endpoints, auth, tests, docs **in parallel**
- `/new-feature` designs and builds **at the same time**
- Tasks that took 10 minutes now take **2-3 minutes**

### Specialized Agents
Each command uses specialized agents for maximum efficiency:
- **Go code** → gopher agent
- **JavaScript** → jsmaster agent
- **Python** → thesnake agent
- **TypeScript** → typegod agent
- **React** → reactlord agent
- **General tasks** → general-purpose agent

## 🔧 Key Features

### Zero Tolerance Mode
- **NO warnings** (not even deprecation)
- **NO console.logs** left behind
- **NO commented code** anywhere
- **NO unused anything**
- If it's not perfect, it's not done

### Visual Progress Tracking
```
✅ Auth Module       | Status: ✅ Complete
❌ Database Schema   | Status: ❌ Failed
   - Missing index on user_id
   - Foreign key constraint issue
```

### Memory System
The system remembers everything using the daddy memory system:
- `store_daddy`: Saves important learnings
- `recall_daddy`: Retrieves past decisions
- `recent_daddy`: Shows recent activity
- `forget_daddy`: Clears old memories

## 🎯 Best Practices

### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- Simple working solution > Complex "proper" solution
- Direct approach > Abstracted approach
- 50 lines that work > 200 lines that's "extensible"
- Readable code > Clever code

### YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
- Build what's needed **NOW**, not what might be needed
- No "future-proofing" without explicit requirements
- No abstract base classes "for extensibility"
- No extra parameters "just in case"
- Delete unused code immediately

### File Discipline
- **NEVER** create files unless explicitly needed
- **NEVER** create documentation unless asked
- **ALWAYS** edit existing files vs creating new ones
- **NEVER** create "helper" or "utility" files proactively

### Research Current Info
Your training data is outdated. ALWAYS:
- Use WebSearch for current best practices
- Use GREP MCP for real-world code patterns
- Use sherlock for package research
- Never say "best practice is" without checking

## 🔄 Common Workflows

### Building a New Feature
```
1. Run: /new-feature [feature name]
2. System handles:
   - Design & architecture
   - Implementation
   - Testing
   - Documentation
3. Results delivered with visual status
```

### Fixing Everything
```
1. Run: /check
2. Watches 6 agents fix all issues in parallel:
   - Code quality
   - Security vulnerabilities
   - Performance issues
   - Test coverage
   - Documentation
   - Build/deployment
3. All issues resolved simultaneously
```

### Shipping to Production
```
1. Run: /check (ensure quality)
2. Run: /deploy
3. System handles:
   - Build process
   - Deployment configuration
   - Production validation
   - Rollback planning
```

## 🎨 Visual Examples

### Progress Tracking
```
| Component    | Status  | Progress |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| Auth         | ✅      | 100%     |
| Database     | ❌      | 75%      |
| API          | ⏳      | 0%       |
```

### Error Reporting
```
❌ Database Schema - Status: Failed
   - Missing index on user_id (Line 142)
   - Foreign key constraint issue (Line 156)
   - Duplicate column definition (Line 89)
```

### Success Summary
```
✅ Feature Complete - Status: All Tasks Done
   - 15 components built
   - 42 tests passing
   - Documentation updated
   - Ready for production
```
